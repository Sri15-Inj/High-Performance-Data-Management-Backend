# High-Performance-Data-Management-Backend
Developed a scalable backend system using SQL, PostgreSQL partitioning, indexing, and Redis caching to manage billions of records and optimize query performance. Leveraged sharding and Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion and high-throughput processing. Deployed the solution on Docker and Kubernetes for fault tolerance and high availability.
